## Snake game
- Why? 
	- There are multiple data structure involve when building classical computer science game. Good practice after all
	- If one understand the bare bone of an classical game theory algorithm, he or she can manipulate and build upon the game. 

- How? 
	- I mostly use `java JFrame` library. 
	- There are only 3 objects involve: Board, Snake, Food
- What did I build? 
	- I implemented the snake game from ground up. 

- What am I planing to do in the future? 
	- I will build upon the idea of snake game by creating a neural network for the snake game, so the snake can play on it own. 
	- Feature for the neural network model:
		- The whole board can be the feature
		- Distance from head to food and the next move to get to the food position  
- Try it out . 
	- Download this project. Run the `jar` file.
